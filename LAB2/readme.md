# Lab 2

## 1. Dataset: Heart Disease (UCI)

### Problem Type
**Classification**

### Target Variable
- **num** (Diagnosis of heart disease)
  - `0`: Healthy
  - `1–4`: Heart disease (increasing levels of severity)

### Key Features
- **Age**: Age of the patient in years.
- **Sex**: Male or Female.
- **CP**: Chest pain type (typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal pain, asymptomatic).
- **Trestbps**: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital).
- **Chol**: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.
- **Thalch**: Maximum heart rate achieved.
- **Exang**: Exercise-induced angina (True/False).
- **Oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.

### Problem Description
The goal of this project is to use clinical measurements to predict the presence and severity of heart disease. By analyzing patient data such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and heart rate during exercise, the model learns to distinguish between healthy individuals and those at risk.
